/* Hereâ€™s what happens:
> ptr is a pointer to Base, but it points to an object of Derived.
> When ptr->display() is called, the call is resolved at runtime.
> The runtime system determines that ptr actually points to a Derived object
    and calls the Derived class's display() method.


Summary:
> Dynamic Binding: Method resolution occurs at runtime.
> Polymorphism: Different classes can be treated uniformly through a common interface.
> Virtual Functions: Enable dynamic binding by using the virtual keyword.
> V-Table: Mechanism used by the compiler to support dynamic binding.
> Flexibility: Allows writing more flexible and maintainable code.
